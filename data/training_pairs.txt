i can't believe you . you told me it was a nubbin .	joey , what did you think a nubbin was ?
harder than it sounds . isn't it ?	okay , you're coming with me , and i also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some jell o with them .
maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here .	maybe . so this is the living room huh ? ooh , it's pretty dark .
okay .	that's it , your doing great .
i couldn't .	i knew it ! because you love rachel .

you do know that wham broke up ?	i like it , and emily likes it , and that's what counts . so uh , how are you guys doing ?
we are gonna be great parents .	and it could be soon . i mean , think about it right now , somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived .
okay , well keep in mind that by the time you're done , they'll probably be serving dinner .	ooh .
it's just , i think , there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby . i mean , now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy . there's always gonna be a reason not to do this , but i think once the baby comes , forget about all those reasons .	i guess . it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby .
i guess you don't .	paolo made a pass at me .
will you grow up ? i'm not talking about sexy stuff , but , like , when i'm cooking naked .	you cook naked ?

wow !	yeah , well . it's the right thing to do .
oh my god . i never thought i'd see this again . it's all here . what made you save it all these years ?	i can't say , i just thought it was really good . and . maybe would be worth something some day .
have you seen your guy's body ?	no , our guy is just a floating head .

ok .	ok , so anyway , you were telling me about paris , it sounds fascinating .
what ?	well , look , it's hardly snowing anymore . i mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting . this could be the simple wedding you've always wanted !
please ! i made this game what it is .	not fun anymore ?
and if that person is already in your life , you should do something about it right ?	yes ! hell yes !
well , she wore it all christmas day , and then uh .	big dog ?

yeah , he's lived here for years , i don't , i don't know what you're talking about man .	no he , he moved out and i moved in .

that's okay , this is more important than fruit on my ceiling ! you broke up ? !	yeah , but it's okay , because when ross left mark came over .
na uh , no , we are all responsible for our own babies .	see that's where i think that you're wrong . we've been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing a zone defense .

wow , she must have hurt you pretty bad , huh ?	well , yeah . y'know , we were best friends , ever since we were little , our moms worked on the barge together .

hey ! hey ! hi ! hey hey hey , i'm rachel ! from upstairs ? the ones with all the pizza ?	oh , is there a problem ?
honey , i don't think that's something we need to worry about ! first of all he's he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her . and even if he did you have no idea how she'd react .	sure , because women never like joey . y'know , i think he's a virgin .

what ?	is to have a long , long talk . y'know ? get joey out on the open road and really open him up .
well uh , she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row . i'm so sorry .	well , why does she not want to hang out with us ? !
why aren't you home yet ? !	is someone there ?
i can't believe ross went out with rachel's sister ! when chandler made out with my sister i was mad at him for years .	that was like years ago .
hey , cut him some slack . it was chandler's idea .	what ?
uh , well . joey and i broke up .	oh my god , wh what happened ?
your hair looks too good , i think it would upset her . ross , why don't you come on in .	yeah .
well , what is it ?	oh , they cut me out of the show .
look , if she's talking to it , i just think that i should get some belly time too . not that i believe any of this .	oh , i believe it . i think the baby can totally hear everything . i can show you . look , this will seem a little weird , but you put your head inside this turkey , and then we'll all talk , and you'll hear everything we say .
you mean the mom you met in montauk . she was a cat ? !	no , no no , she was a human lady . this is the spirit of my mom lily , the one who killed herself .
those are my shoes .	oh , when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping .
what ?	i just i don't think us getting back together is a good idea .
hey , isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table ? rachel's ! but good to know where you're at !	hey !
would you like to move over to the couch ?	mmm hmm .
can i get some ice here ? !	oh anyway , i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are .
oh , it's ross's bachelor party .	sooo ?

what are you doing ? !	nothing ! i swear to god i didn't know you guys would be here ! and the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates . so .
that's what we were gonna name the baby .	phoebe !
hey !	you are never going to believe what happened to me today .
well actually , ross doesn't .	yes , and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet .
it took you that long to figure it out , huh ?	well i'm , i'm a little slow . just as our children would be .

hey is this true , that you write a lot of your own lines ?	uh , well , kinda yeah . like , remember last week when alex was in the accident ? well the line in the script was , 'if we don't get this woman to a hospital , she's going to die .' but i made it , ' if this woman doesn't get to a hospital , she's not gonna live .'
oh , ross .	what ?
don't go .	what ?

you know what's really good here , the lobster . what do you say shall i just order three .	yeah , if you're really hungry . it was a joke , i made a joke .
you know what ? you know what ? i think we're making too big a deal out of this . ok ? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things . and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change . you're chef . what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?	ok worse case scenario is . we borrow some money from my parents .
i'm sorry , i don't understand what you just said .	let them win one .
maybe it's not as bad as i think . y'know , maybe they didn't take it the way i meant it .	absolutely ! y'know , because touchie can mean both ass and good worker .
and and you're using my name !	yeah , can i help you with something ?
yeah !	what are you talking about pheebs ? i don't . oh my god , you drew on me ? !
i like them a lot .	that's not what i had in mind ! see , people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants . you see , they're very tight . maybe there's something in that area .

trying to date this woman .	right ! but , none of that compared to how kind and and how gentle and thoughtful he is .
chandler look , i don't want to be one of those wives who says , you can't go to the game . you have to spend time with me . so , if you could just realize it on your own .	i know . you're right . i want to see you too . i've just got to figure out a way to tell joey , you know ? he's really looking forward to this .

you know how much i love that t shirt ! you never even where that t shirt !	i'm just trying to help you , move on .
i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person . i mean , it's leaving behind a piece of your heart .	sandy , that's exactly what it is .

most of you don't know me , i'm rachel's boyfriend .	oh dear god .

yeah , were better off without them .	and y'know , even if they break up again , you'd better not let him in your sad men's club !
if it's not a right angle , it is a wrong angle .	very good .
hey !	hi !
oh that's a great idea . you're really good on the phone .	yeah and yeah , and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had . y'know , i probably wouldn't have to say spank as much .
hey ! i'm sorry ! that where are you going ?	my folks .

youre doing it again .	were not doing anything . were just sitting around talking , quietly .

oh , come on !	chasing him all around the room ?
nooo !	this is a very critical time right now . if you feel yourself reaching for that phone , then you go shoe shopping , you get your butt in a bubble bath . you want her back you have to start acting aloof .

of course not . i mean gosh , chandler what you did , it's , it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it . i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place , but i'd never expect you to worry about that .	really ?

that's what you said last night .	what i said was , was that i understood . joey's the one who agreed with you !
you know , it's so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and i've never heard about you .	yeah , that's because we had a bit of a falling out . mike hit my mom with a car .

oh , and i promise , i will not fake it this time .	i wish i could say the same . i'm a little shook up !
well what did you send ?	a basket of mini muffins .
yeah . but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .	anyway , it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people . okay ? it's a lot of work .
i'm just serving it .	yeah . yeah , i'll have a cup of coffee .
i have nothing to say to you .	wow , my flat is twice this size !
no , no , no , i actually it's any baby animals kittens , fish babies . you know . especially veal . and this , this nice vein of fat running through it . hmmm . yummy hmmm .	so . ? what do you think ?
okay ! you don't think i thought of that ?	how can you not know which one ?

well , have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up ?	no . but . it only has to happen once . look , you and i both know we are perfect for each other , right ? i mean . so , the only question is . are you attracted to me ?

i will be ! listen , i don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore . okay ?	fine . fine , but i'll have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel . and i loved being fun aunt rachel but i'll go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if that's what you want !
sure , okay .	okay . okay , great ! umm , okay , just turn around .
maybe there's someone else .	wha .

ross is coming over . i think now would be a really good time to talk to him .	i guess so . i'm just . really nervous .
hey !	we didn't get to the audition . i'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then .
joey no , this is wrong ! you have to take it back , okay ? you don't want to win an award this way . you're very talented . and someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something .	all right !
oh well , i guess i'll catch up with her later .	well , she really wanted to talk to you now .
uh oh , it was bad ?	it was fine , y'know ? but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with joey . she was more like , i see you point , i'm all right with it .
i know monica's worst thanksgiving .	oh , let's not tell this story .
calm down . maybe you're not pregnant .	what ? !
bye .	tonight ?
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem ?	it was really fun being married to you tonight .
yeah .	okay . so uh , ross is kinda bummed huh ?
you didn't get it ?	no .
i'm so sorry .	what do we do ?
joey told me , he saw you two kissing .	in the park ?

ohh ! that's great !	you know , junior miss is where i started . oh , i had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job .
that was pretty intense huh ?	yeah . hey , i hope ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here !
eight dollars and cents . but not really , 'cause i put in the first two , just to , you know , get the ball rolling , and to make myself feel better .	do you ?
no because it it didn't seem important .	oh , it's not important ? it's not important ? ! if it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me !
nana liked it rough !	hi !
yeah .	yeah .
i don't , i don't understand . i mean , you , it's like we can't win with you guys .	if you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault . maybe that's just how you feel .
oh , that's why you got these tickets to that play , to get rid of us ? ?	yeah .
hey , pheebs .	how's it going ?
what , you don't think i know that ?	look , the point is , there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet !

you don't know do you ?	no , couldn't care less .
fine , fine , rachel your with monica , joey you're with me .	i can not believe your trading me ! !

no . no , i gotta go home sometime .	you be okay ?
okay ! okay ! okay ! oh god , i thought . wait a minute , i i can do this . i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it . then i realized the only thing that matters is that you , you make me happier than i ever thought i could be . and if you'll let me , i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way . monica , will you marry me ?	yes .

rach , rach , we gotta settle .	settle what ?
no no ! i i . i found one .	okay .
stay well .	okay , now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today .

no ! okay ! okay ! okay , look , can i , can i just just talk to you for a second ?	yeah , sure .
no .	excellent ! excellent ! and uh , finally , are you into any weird stuff y'know , sexually ?

chandler , i found the perfect ring .	oh , that's uh , that's pretty nice but i'm gonna go with the one i picked first .
i'm sorry rachel , i'm sorry .	oh , come on ! you think that's gonna work on me ? ! i invented that !
phoebe , are you okay ?	yeah . yeah , i'll be alright .

hey , hi , i need a ladle . you got a ladle ?	we have a ladle .
oh my god ! you're water broke !	ohh !
oh !	joey . erica , baby !
well , of course .	do you want to go out on a date with her ?
okay , but pheebs , pheebs , jack gave up a cow , i gave up an orthodontist . okay , i i i know , i know i didn't love him	oh , see , jack did love the cow .
why can't you tell her ?	'cause i only have one quarter , and i think my time is about to
take thee , em i ly .	take thee , emily . like there'd be anybody else .
yeah that seems fair . we never use them .	look , i really need some help , okay ? why ? why did i have to speak in a british accent ? ! what do i do ?
is everything okay ?	yeah , everything's fine !
well , i guess i'll see you at the wedding .	umm listen , i don't think . i don't think i'm gonna make it to the wedding . so i just want to wish you all the luck in the world .
do you really not know where i'm going with this ? it left ! it's one huge room !	oh no ! oh ! wow ! ! !

why ? because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time ?	well , that's pretty much all i'm looking for from these people .
no , you cannot .	thanks for the help , problem solved .
that does make sense . because i do wanna seize some opportunity , but i i really don't wanna see or talk to her .	well , there you go !
staying out of the way .	this is impossible monica , why don't you just pick all ?
it is okay , if i stay and watch ?	yeah ! why don't you stick around . you can sit right there .

you know what , i can't do this . i don't know which one of you guys to pick .	oh , you haven't picked yet . oh good , 'cause i had an idea . i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog . chappy .
mindy .	hey , you .
all right , first name on the speed dial is mom .	ohh , i lost my mom to suicide .
i didn't know that .	ok , then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you , tough , 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that .
yeah , it was .	all right then . bye .
so do you think that my dream means anything ?	i don't know . i mean , you saw him do a love scene , so maybe you don't have a thing for joey , maybe you have a thing for drake .

woah .	look at this , how did i spend so much money ?
hey , look , you're in trouble either way ! okay ? if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair , she's gonna know you were in here . so you might as well just let me go .	what if i clean your bathroom for a month ?

hey pheebs ! listen , uh can you do me a favor ? i forgot the pin number to my atm card can , can you get it for me ?	sure ! where is it ?
is this about mark ?	oh my god .
oh , just do it ! !	op , op , i'm convinced !
i know but it's so hard ! nothing rhymes with your stupid name !	what are you talking about ? lots of things rhyme with rachel . bagel . mail . jail . bail . able . may pole .
yeah , i know . he can get really competitive .	ha . ha , ha .
is something wrong ?	no . no i'm just tired . y'know , from from the walk .
oh , y'know what , that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling , that might be all right with rachel .	whoa whoa whoa whoa ! is this , hot rachel , that you took to the christmas party , rachel ?
y'know , when we talked about face to face , i don't think we thought it all the way through .	so what do you want me to do ?
we , we just wanna see the end .	i want you drake .
y'know what ? i'm really not in the mood .	look , ross , i feel really bad . i mean , you're going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk .
your license ?	yes . here you go officer uh , handsome .
ohh ! !	yes !
hey !	hey !
no , we just went out .	you're smart . i like that .
you're kidding !	that's terrible !
are you kidding ? i love that guy ! morning's here ! morning is here	stop it ! i will kill you . i hate the fact that my room is so small .
so ?	i feel really sad that we're not . really there anymore .
well , because she loves you and because you love her .	yeah , so , what's that supposed to mean ? !
y'know what daddy ? if you don't like ross , that's fine . it doesn't matter to me , i'm gonna go out with him anyway .	really ? !
pheebs , i would make a reservation for five , because one of us has to stay home and watch emma . which one of us should go to dinner ?	oh , rachel !
he's . our age .	when we were ?
'kay , first of all , this attitude is not helping .	she's not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place .
you know what else i'm not gonna miss ? i'm monica . i wash the toilet times a day . even if people are on it !	hi i'm rachel , is my sweater too tight ? no ? oh , i'd better wash it and shrink it !
okay . then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason .	maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here .
and then you tried to make me think that i was crazy .	you're right , that was wrong . i'm sorry . i'm so sorry . it's just that i liked you so much . can we just , can we just start over ?
chandler ? forty five minutes ? well , something is not right . i just can't believe he would do this to monica !	i know , and with the baby coming ?
listen , i need to ask you something . ok , you know how my step dad's in prison .	yeah .
more than i wanna get married .	ok people , we are back in business ! oh god , we've missed you soo much ! ok , go and get your hair and make up done , and i'll take care of everything .
i just wish they'd realise they should be together .	i know , i know . and when they moved back in together , i figured y'know , that's where things were headed .
so i uh , i just talked to the director . that's it , we're done for the day .	well have we finished the scene ?
ah , we're out . i sold them all .	what ?
well actually you're the one person i can't tell this too . and the one person i want to the most .	what's going on ?
well umm , if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else .	oh yeah ! i i would like that .
hey ! you're a good dancer !	really ?
really .	i mean , that's a typical guy response .
listen , i i need a favor . umm , i was in the shower , and as i was cleansing myself , i ah , i i , well i felt something .	was it like a sneeze only better ?
and ?	and we did .
it's ok , because they have to get it out of their system , okay , but you're going to realize , this is the only place , you wanna be .	actually , we already found a house we love .
uh , don't you mean for whom ?	sure , listen i was gonna order some pizza , you wanna share one ?
oh , did i not mention ? carl is a guy i hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project .	y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you , aren't they ?
i guess with you doing the internship , we're just spending more than we're bringing in .	maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .
how drunk are you ?	drunk enough to know that i want to do this . not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage .
what am i supposed to do with these ?	ah , come on , sneakers are easy . you wear sneakers all the time .
wow !	what ?
all right , everybody open them !	ooh ! oh wow this is so beautiful .
check this out ? huh ? yeah . that's the stuff . what do you think ?	well , i don't have to buy that , i'm with stupid t shirt anymore .
no , let me explain ! fired ! !	all right , fine ! fine ! have me fired ! but uh , i want you to know that you and i are not all that different . i mean , i too am a neat guy .
oh , i'm sorry , so 'we' is ?	'we' would be me and rick .
yep !	do you wanna do it at the same time ?

ok , great !	oh , thank god i can't hear a word that you're saying !
ohh wow ! i'm sorry , but ross you kicked off your shoes !	can we , can we just forget this ever happened ?
yeah , i've got something you can do .	what , what is it ?

ok , hey , hey . is your boyfriend the boss of you ?	no .

oh , no , please , i spent most of mid morning trying to stand up . now uh , what can i do for you , my dear ?	i don't know how to say this , but i think when your wife's spirit left her body , it um , kind of stuck around in me .

i knew that was him !	anyway i just , uh , i think it's for the best .

how to make the next one even shorter ?	now wait a minute that's not fair . he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily , he just didn't tell me . maybe i have to pee again .
no , rachel doesn't want me to . .	look , i i i am sorry that rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that mark guy , and you are the innocent victim in all of this , but don't punish your friends for what rachel did to you .

yeah !	hey ! well . ?
car accident .	oh .

do you all promise ?	yeah ! we promise ! we'll be good !
hey , rachel , can can i see you for a sec ?	sure ! oh .

stop it ! marcel ! bad monkey !	what ?
just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it , but your bosses didn't . then that way , you're the good guy and they're the bad guys .	that's good ! i liked it , they didn't . joey , for god's sake , go to work ! .
rachel ! ! monica ! !	come on !

thank you . come meet my friends . this is uh , phoebe .	hi , nice to meet you .
go get back on that case honey !	i don't think the next patient is very far along .

i can't , i can't even believe her ! no , y'know what , i am , i am gonna go !	good !
oh .	so , all right .
look , i'm not happy about this either , but y'know if if ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves . are you cool with that ?	no ! but y'know , i'm an actor , i'll act cool .
in fact , i'll bet you bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us . eh , y'know what , better yet ? a week .	i'll take that bet my friend . and you know what , paying me the bucks could be the new thing you do that day ! and it starts right now !
ok , all right .	hey , julie , i didn't know you wore lenses .
i'm gonna get you to talk to chandler .	all right . but if you weren't my best friend .
i can't get married until i get something old , something new , something borrowed , and something blue .	okay , all right , all right , all right ! okay ! okay , here's something , here's something blue and new .
well now , how how do you fit into this whole thing ?	well , carol says she and susan want me to be involved , but if i'm not comfortable with it , i don't have to be involved . . basically it's entirely up to me .
no .	i don't think so .

this is insane !	what's the big deal , y'know ? it's not like it's a real marriage .
we share a wall ! so either he's great in bed , or she just likes to agree with him a lot .	sweetie , with you it's gonna be different . the sex is gonna be great , 'cause you you guys are in love .
okay , remember uh , remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms ?	yeah ?
that's a defense ?	yes . yes it is . i burned the formula and i put your diapers on backwards . i mean , i made up a song to sing you to sleep , but that made you cry even more !
what's wrong ?	i am so much older than these other interns . i can't compete with them .
i uh , went to a bar . and then i just uh , just walked around for a while .	you walked around all night in the city by yourself ?
monica face it , chandler is against marriage . and and always will be !	well there's some people who do want to marry me .

no , i can't . no no , listen , i , i know how much this means to you and i also know that this is about more than just jewelry , it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds .	wow , is this friendship ? i think so . check it out , we're bracelet buddies .
hey , ross ! ! ! i told you i don't !	don't yell at me okay , this is the most i've seen you all week .
that's not true , you don't have a moustache .	okay , okay , one thing's changed . but we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end .
oh , this is fun .	you're ready to have a baby ? my boy's all grown up !
that's right . you're husband's home . so , now the sex can stop .	what are you saying ?
you're lookin' at it upside down y'know what ? it doesn't matter .	yeah , it's not like i don't have a sense of humor , huh ? hell , i even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then . but there's a time and a place , huh ? ! unless you uh , have a limerick right now ? no ? okay , well uh , you've got my fax number .

hi , um , i'm gonna need a new set of these forms .	why ?
not me .	may i ask why ?
ross .	oh no , maybe it's me , i'm just not giving you enough credit . uh , i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people . uh , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , good . it's physically impossible . you know what ? after all we've been through , i can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us . have a , have a good time in paris .
no . and then i called him , and he wasn't there .	well , then he's , he's probably just , out .
let me see that . oh , yeah .	that's one ?
that won't go with this dress though .	no , you're right . well , we'll find something . let's just get you out of that . come on .
all right , wait ! come on ! just wait one second ! there has to be something that i can do ! something ! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down . what ?	we've got a box .
well , i'll be waiting for you , just come up when you're done .	okay , i'll be up in , pages . front and back . very exciting .
yeah and you better watch the flirting too , cause you know , in such close quarters , it could be trouble .	well , that's gonna be tough mon . i mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt .
what kinda stuff ?	will you grow up ? i'm not talking about sexy stuff , but , like , when i'm cooking naked .
oh god , don't tell me , i did it wrong .	no no . nothing wrong about that .
oh my god . hello ?	joey , it's estelle .
zelner .	zelner ! right ! i knew that ! i really , really want this job and i think , i think i would be really good at it .
what happened ? joey ?	all right .
hey !	how'd the lecture go ?
and it works both ways .	okay , so you both just know this stuff ?
which i may say , right now , is out of control .	he gave me a pill for it .
why don't i take you out ?	what ? ! joey , you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady .
uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there ?	no . i'm all alone .
i have to go scream into a pillow .	bouncy baby , bouncy baby , ooh baby baby , ooh baby baby , ooh baby baby .
easy . step . how did it get on ?	i put it on to scare chandler !
no , i gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks .	did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed ?
nothing . i just think it's nice when we're all here together .	even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear . .
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you . and the reason why she couldn't , is because her feelings were so strong , it scared her . now you go home and wait for her call , she could be calling you from the plane ! come on now go ! go !	okay ! okay ! but if she doesn't call , it is definitely over ! no , wait . wait . unless , eventually , i call her , y'know just to she what's going on , and , and she says she'll call me back , but then she doesn't . then it's over .
oh my god ! this is a six hour pill ! that's it ! i'm out of the woods ! ohh ! what a relief !	good for you !
look we've got to find her . phoebe just called ! ! rachel's coming to tell ross she loves him ! !	oh my god !
oh no , not yet .	i still cannot believe you're engaged ! just 'cause its happening so fast not 'cause you're such a loser .
okay , this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married !	phoebe you can't have both of them ! you have to pick one !
this doesn't concern you ! !	oh ! sorry , i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name !
hey , what time is it ? the big game is about to start !	you don't have to do that , ross and joey aren't here , you can watch the parade if you want .
please , just just , just go and talk to rachel .	yeah , i guess i should . man , y'know what i have to realize ? maybe i'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with . y'know , they they always seem to want a little bit more . i should remember that .

all my energy is going into not asking that question . i can't believe i screwed this up !	i'm sorry man . here's a thought . this is the same ballroom . there's a band . there's gonna be plenty of dressed up people .

it took two people to break up this relationship ! !	yeah ! you and that girl from that copy place , which yesterday you took full responsibility for ! !
i see . you didn't happen to tell .	. everybody we know ? yeah .
i do like that .	it's harder for me ! i have those four other women to compete with !
yeah , refrigerator college .	yeah .
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees .	ho , ho , ho ! merry christmas !
fine , so you don't like them . everybody else does .	again , let's journey back . as i recall what rachel said , was she had never notice the shape of your skull before . and joey . well , joey didn't realise that there was anything different .
i can't believe it ! she's asleep ! i got her to go to sleep ! i have actual magical powers !	i can hear traffic and birds ! i can hear the voices in my head again ! i'm kidding .
no . sweetie , you're gonna be fine .	wait wait where are you going ? where are you going ?
no that's not true . that is not true .	oh yeah .
yes that was mine .	'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there .
i swear i've seen birds do this on wild kingdom .	what are you guys doing here ?
really ?	yeah ! when you were talking about roger , that was killing me ! look , things like last night they don't just happen . y'know ? or at least not to me . or with the other two women , in the morning y'know i was just lying there and i couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends , but with you i always y'know with a friend .
what ? oh yeah , yeah i think so . why am i invited to this again ?	well apparently albert has no friends . he's very excited about the bachelor party though . i think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper .
okay .	anyway , hopefully , i'll see you around sometime .
oh wait , no no no ! drag me down . drag drag me down .	forget it rachel ! we're both so proud of how well you're doing . i'm not gonna let you blow it . in fact , if i catch you with a cigarette , you're fired . so go on , get out of here ! go on , i don't want you breathing this stuff ! go on !
i think that's gum .	i'm pretty sure it's gun .
yeah , i'm sorry . i'm i'm so sorry .	for what dear ? for not inviting me or lying about it ?
your mom , your telling me , your telling me , about your mom , what is the matter with you ?	you said .

so ?	yeah , we're gonna be fine ! get out !

what ? ! wait a minute ! no wait a minute ! okay ? look , that night was the one wild thing i have ever done in my entire life , and i'm not gonna let you take that away from me ! okay , so if you don't remember that , maybe you will remember this !	my god ! you love me !
yeah ?	well , she told me that i'm gonna die this week , so i'm kinda bummed about that .
chandler , you have to start getting over her . all right , if you play , you get some fresh air , maybe it'll take your mind off janice , and if you don't play , everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even . come on .	yeah , all right , i'll play .
and and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in .	so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor .
oh , i will .	me too .

yay , i rock .	and you know why ? because you told the truth , and nobody ever tells kids the truth .you were incredible .
so we'll leave before it's over , we'll be back in time .	you say that now , but it could take us a long time to get back home . plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .

all right . i'll tell you what . when we're , if neither one of us are married , what do you say you and i get together and have one ?	why won't i be married when i'm ?
yeah !	look , we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable .

hot dog ?	four , please . i'm really nervous . thank you .

uh , uh , uh , i am here .	i know that .
yes , bunny ?	peach pit . that night we , uh we had
what happened ?	all right , we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me . y'know maybe he was going to open the door , but i totally miss read him and i uhhh .
what kind of job is that for a man ? a nanny ? i it's like if a woman wanted to be .	yes ?
one .	one .
what ?	i was doing great with julie before i found out about you .
hey ! hi bonnie !	hi ! my boss let me off early , so i took the train .
what ?	she's living my life , and she's doing it better than me ! look at this , look . she buys tickets for plays that i wanna see . she , she buys clothes from stores that i'm intimidated by the sales people . she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies .
over here jack . ok . i see , rachel's coming up the path . oh doesn't she look pretty . jack , get this .	oh my god .
come on look guys , don't fight .	and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend . and if you were a good friend , you'd be doing the same thing .
oh , i missed you so much !	i knew you'd be here !
monica , i want a baby too , but this woman is giving away her child . she deserves to know who it's going to .	okay , right .
oh !	i'm sorry . are you ok with that ? cause if not . maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea .
okay , will you just go help her change please !	okay , but taking care of a drunk , naked woman seems like a job for joey .
hey , there's missy goldberg . you gotta remember her .	sure , nice .
i have like five times , but the guy is so charming , that i go up there to yell and then i end up apologizing to him .	ooh , that is silly . i'll go up there , i'll tell him to keep it down .
listen , i'm sure that dad doesn't care . he probably thought this was funny he'll be telling this story for years !	i don't want him to tell this story for years .
what ? !	so you were right ?
hey rach , can you pass me the tv guide ?	yep !
no , the doctors say it may kill her .	what are you two girls whispering about over there ? !
um mmm , and i won't have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address .	that's great , but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star ?
yes , we are very sorry to tell you this , but you , phoebe , are flaky .	hah !
yeah , maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere .	look i'm sorry you guys , i i just don't think so .
hey ! out of all of us , who do you think is gonna get married next ?	probably monica and chandler .
pheebs , you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec ?	oh , sure ! bye ross ! forever .
what ? !	who did you originally want to hook up with ?
cassie , how you how you doin' on that . hot dog .	i'm all done .
then all your stuff would be here .	well , what if all my stuff was here ?
no problem roomie .	can i ask you a question ?
well okay , so then you're fine . the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off stage all the sexual tension between them is gone . okay ? so as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about . it's when the heat goes away , that's when you're in trouble .	really ?
well , the lighting was okay .	ohh no you don't ! you got lighting last time , lighting is mine !
hey !	hey !
yeah . uh huh , i guess it is pretty big news .	pretty big ? it's huge ! god , this guy doesn't have a clue ! he's just walking down the street thinking , 'i had sex with rachel green . i rock !' then bam ! he's a father and everything's different .

erica , please . just consider us . ask them to see our file . our last name's bing . my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising .	oh yeah . i actually liked you guys . but it doesn't matter , because what you did was wrong .

oh come on ! are you listening to this ?	i'm so sorry .
i don't think so .	oh , i do . how you doin ?

umm , anyway . do you want to have dinner tonight ?	yes ! oh no !
hey hey come on you guys , give him a break . ross , seriously , how's it going with her ?	well , actually it's been great . she's so she's not looking for anything too serious , which is perfect for me right now .

if anyone asks , we'll just say ben addressed them . oh ! so you invited rachel then ?	sure . why not ?
pheebs , i still need some help here .	oh right , ok um . ok so its not just the lie you tell . but its the way you tell it . . for example if you look down at the ground when you're talking , people know you're lying .
well , i i said yes .	what ? ! are you crazy ? you just had ross's baby ! it's it's so inappropriate . no , it's worse than that . it's wrong . it's . it is bigger than mine !

ok , uh , hey richard , if you had an extra ticket to the knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick ?	wow . well being a huge knicks fan myself , i think you should take someone who's a huge knicks fan .
rach , i told you , you can't call him every time any little thing comes up .	yeah well , not anymore i can't . he fired us ! what are we gonna do ? we have to find a pediatrician . wait wait , monica said that when you guys were growing up , you really liked your doctor . what was his name ?
that guy's still doing that ? !	hey ! oh my god you're here , let me see your hand ! !

well , i'm confused . i thought we shared time .	no no . see , in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast . you wanna know why ?
phoebe !	okay , let's talk outside .
ah ! okay so that would make me susan .	right . are you looking for jack's parents to discuss the problems he's having with ben ? yeah . because i really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation .
chandler , if that dog's been here that long , and you haven't had a reaction , maybe you're not allergic to this dog ?	well , it still has to go , right ?
he better go on for what i'm paying .	after what he just said , you're paying for the whole bloody lot .

i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out !	i wasn't checking her out . i'm in fashion , i was looking at her skirt . or was it pants ? i didn't really see what happened below the ass area .
phoebe , relax none of that stuff ever happens ! they just put it on there for legal reasons !	why ?
hey , joey , could you pass the cheese ?	yeah . listen uh , i'd prefer it if you didn't call me joey . since i don't know anyone here , i thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname .
you were gonna drink the fat .	let's see what else he'll do !
what do you think brought than on ?	i don't know ! i mean , maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .

whoa , hey ! what are doing ? trying to get me drunk ?	i'm just making margaritas .
why would you say that ?	'cause you're still into monica . so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you , so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together , maybe something might happen , and .
listen , i'm in elizabeth's bathroom .	nice !
this is insane , i'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor .	make love ? what are you a girl ?

yeah , i guess , but what's like heads and what's tails ?	well it you don't know that , then i don't want to do this with you .

so umm , what time are you supposed to leave ?	this is the last call for flight to athens . the last call .
oh wow , you are really , you're really a creep .	why do you even care if i was looking at her ? are you jealous ?
really ?	honey , someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world .
i know , i want that too , but is that going to make it too hard ?	it can't be any harder than this . i mean , if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time , i . i would have stopped to memorize your face , the way you move , everything about you . if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time . i never would have stopped .
