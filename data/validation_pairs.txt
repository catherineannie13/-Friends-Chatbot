good , because it's in ten minutes .	what ? i can't do that ! i have the baby , and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour .
this doesn't feel weird !	i know .
emily is kinda taking a long time , huh ?	y'know when i locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding , it was because i was trying to pop the window out of the frame .
all right , ross , i just have to do one thing , really quickly , it's not a big deal . get up ! !	hi .
oh . okay , sorry !	well , you seem pretty insulted by that . what ? i'm not good enough for you ?

you completely stole my answer !	well , honey that was pretty obvious .
hi .	are you , are you high ?
rach !	what ? !
i know !	i mean seriously , she's like the perfect woman . i mean i know she turned me down , but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me , i would take her in my arms and . i haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have i ?
i was making a coconut phone with the professor .	richard told monica he wants to marry her !
oh umm , how about your mom dying , or having to live on the streets when you were ?	uh huh . oh , yeah , i could write about the time my hair did that woo hoo thing .
it looked like we were gonna lose her this morning , but she's a tough old bird .	ahh .

i'll get our seats .	okay . so uh , well , this this is uh , this is awkward .
it's not random , it's bob .	it's probably because not mature enough . or smart enough . maybe he doesn't like the way i dress no that can't be it . it's really gotta be the smart thing . oh i'm so stupid ! i'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl !
listen , this is totally getting out of hand ! okay ? she wants me to put lotion on her !	she's bluffing !
yes , and they should name one of their kids joey . i may not have kids someone's gotta carry on the family name .	you know what ? maybe once they start dating , and they see what's out there , they'll realise how good they are for each other .
hey ! did you find them ?	yeah , they're stuck inside the table !
oh ! maybe they'll name yours after you ! y'know , they'll call it , the ross . and then people would be like , awww , he's got a ross .	yeah , that'd be cool !

no , no , rachel ?	yeah .
it seems your daughter and richard are something of an item .	that's impossible , he's got a twinkie in the city .

okay i've got one for you , if you had too which one would you rather eat , a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla ?	i'd have to say . the talking gorilla , because at least i can explain to him that you're making me eat him .
chandler , this actually bothers you ?	yes , it does bother me ! and i think it would bother a lot of people . rachel , when you were going out with ross , did it bother you when he flirted with other women ?

you're kidding me ? i mean , it's enough that you are a doctor . but on top of it , you're married to a reverend ?	i don't think that's exactly .

okay , let me just jump in and ask , at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?	rach , come on , if you think about it , it's actually kinda funny . okay , maybe it's best not to think about it .

oh ! ok , yeah , i think i can do that . yeah ok , there's this party scene coming up . . and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her , but he can't . and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you , but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool , but really , it was killing me .	joey , you never . .you never talked about that before .
this is unbelievable phoebs , how can you be married ?	well , i mean , i'm not married married , ya know , he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from canada and he just needed a green card .

oh , all right , i'll just have what she's having instead .	oh , i'm sorry sir , that was our last piece .
maybe it's the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .	it's coming from the living room .
hey rach !	hey .
look everyone , it's the spirit of thanksgiving !	so are things with you and joey any better ?
well , remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ? well , when ross said rachel at the wedding , i figured it was gonna happen again , so i hid this in here .	ooh , candy bars , crossword puzzles .
oh well , as long as it is under control , you know , you can't do anything about it , he's already dating her , and she is a nice person , that wouldn't be right .	i know , i know , so it is just not a big deal .
are you gonna let me play ?	all right then .
what ? is it is this 'cause of what ross said ?	no . well , yeah , maybe .
how might you be wrong ?	well y'know , what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy ?
nice . and by the way that uh , that line down my face ?	what line ?
oh yes !	oh no no no no no , no you don't !

this place is so depressing . if i had to work here i'd kill myself . but you obviously haven't .	how can i help you ?
okay .	i'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my i'm sorry , uh apparently i've opened the door to the past .

yeah , i admit it . i have a crush on you , and uh , and , and i know that's crazy because we work together , and and nothing could ever happen , and the last thing i want to do is is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable . which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now .	oh my god ! those guys are stealing my car !
you like someone . tell me who it is . who is it ?	no .
i'm sorry , i , i just need a little time .	okay .
janice , i have something i need to tell you , and i want you to let me get through it , because it's , it's , it's not gonna be easy .	okay .

oh ! oh by the way ?	uh hmm .
then i blame you ! yeah ! that's right ! you threw me off with all your slapping !	ok well , well i'm really , i'm sorry about that joey , but do you think that maybe on some level , you don't want to take off my bra ?
oh yeah , sure , that makes sense . yeah . 'cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back , then she called you and told you that there's another guy , so yeah , go to london that'll scare her !	when rachel was with paulo , what did you do ?
that's really nice .	i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable .
